title: Create a GCP Service Account
ref: create-a-gcp-service-account
content: |

  Create a service account for your client application by following the
  official Google documentation on
  `Creating and managing a service account <https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts#creating>`__.

  After you create the service account, locate and record the following
  authentication settings for use in a later step:

  - **email**
  - **privateKey** (this value is only returned when you create the account)
  - **endpoint**

  The following diagram shows how the **master key** is created and stored
  on a KMS provider:

  Create a **symmetric key** using the official Google Cloud
  `Creating symmetric keys guide <https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/creating-keys>`__.
  This is your master key which you can access from your application.

  .. note::

     If you rotate the key whether by specifying a date or manually, the
     provider changes the content of the master key. In order to transition
     to using the new key, you need to perform the following steps:

     - decrypt and save the data using the original data encryption key
     - generate a new data encryption key with the new master key
     - update the ``keyVersion`` parameter to the latest version of the master
       key
     - re-encrypt the data using the new data encryption key

  Make sure your application has appropriate roles to encrypt and decrypt
  using the key. For example, the
  `roles/cloudkms.cryptoKeyEncrypterDecrypter <https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/reference/permissions-and-roles>`__
  role has permissions to both encrypt and decrypt keys.

  .. important::

     The client application *should not* have administrative permissions
     for the master key. We recommend that you follow the
     `principle of least privilege <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege>`__
     to keep your data secure.

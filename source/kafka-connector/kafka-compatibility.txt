MongoDB Compatibility
---------------------

Kafka Sink Connector
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **Kafka Sink Connector** requires MongoDB 3.6 or later; it is
unsupported for older versions of MongoDB.

Kafka Source Connector
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **Kafka Source Connector** requires MongoDB 3.6 or later as your data
source if you are using change streams with a **collection** only. If you
need to watch a **database** or **deployment**, you need MongoDB 4.0 or
later.

.. note::

   The MongoDB Connector for Apache Kafka is only tested against MongoDB
   clusters. If you use the MongoDB Kafka connector with a non-genuine
   MongoDB database, it may not function correctly due to differences in
   features or feature behavior.

Kafka Compatibility
-------------------

The **MongoDB Connector for Apache Kafka** requires Apache Kafka Connect
API version 2.1.0 or later and is tested against Apache Kafka 2.3 and
above. There are many Kafka compatible platforms that work with the Kafka 
Connect service such as:

- Confluent Platform 5.3 or later
- Microsoft Azure Event Hubs
- Red Hat AMQ Streams

The MongoDB Connector works directly with Kafka Connect; it does not make 
direct connections to the Kafka cluster on the backend.  Therefore, the 
MongoDB Connector should work with any Apache Kafka platform that supports 
Kafka Connect including those listed above.  If you have any questions about 
the connector, feel free to ask on the 
`MongoDB Community Forums <https://developer.mongodb.com/community/forums/c/connectors-integrations/>`__.

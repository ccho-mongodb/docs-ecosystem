Introduction
------------

`Apache Kafka <https://kafka.apache.org>`_ is a *distributed streaming
platform* that implements a publish-subscribe pattern to offer streams of
data with a durable and scalable framework.

The `Apache Kafka Connect API <https://www.confluent.io/connectors/>`_ is
an interface that simplifies integration of a data system, such as
a database or distributed cache, with a new **data source** or a
**data sink**.

The `MongoDB Kafka connector <https://www.mongodb.com/kafka-connector>`_ is
a Confluent-verified connector that persists data from Kafka topics as a
data sink into MongoDB as well as publishes changes from MongoDB into Kafka
topics as a data source. This guide provides information on available
configuration options and examples to help you complete your
implementation.
